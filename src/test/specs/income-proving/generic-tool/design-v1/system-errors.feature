    Scenario: Handling API server validation errors - missing parameter
        Given the api response is a validation error - missing parameter
        When the income check is performed
        Then the service displays the following page content
            | Server Error        | You can’t use this service just now. The problem will be fixed as soon as possible |

    @Slow
    Scenario: Don't retry for error responses from the API
    If the API responds with a valid HTTP response, whether success, client error, server error, we don't retry.
    Note that we have to pause the scenario before verifying the number of calls, to allow for any retry attempts (that shouldn't not happen)
        Given the api response has status 503
        When the income check is performed
        And after at least 4 seconds
        Then the connection attempt count should be 1
        And after at least 2 seconds
        # NB Above line is a temp fix to stop the following test failing.

    @Slow
    Scenario: Retrying after an API connection timeout
    Retry the API call if there is a refused connection or a connection timeout
    Delay the API response for long enough that the timeout occurs. The API request should retry a certain number of times.
    The values for timeout and number of attempts is found in application-test.properties.
    Note that we have to pause the scenario for long enough for all the retries to happen before we try to verify the count.
        Given the api response is delayed for 2 seconds
        When the income check is performed
        And after at least 4 seconds
        Then the connection attempt count should be 2
